# sil_graphql_client

`sil_graphql_client` is an open source project &mdash; it's one among many other shared libraries that make up the wider ecosystem of software made and open sourced by `Savannah Informatics Limited`.

It is a shared library between [BeWell-Consumer] and [BeWell-Professional] and is responsible for putting together everything that these app needs in order to run safely. It is like a small preflight check.
